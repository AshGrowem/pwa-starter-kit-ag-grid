# PWA Starter Kit + Ag-Grid

This is a clone of [pwa-starter-kit](https://github.com/Polymer/pwa-starter-kit) with the View 1 tab replaced with a simple Ag-Grid example.

I made this to save others the trouble I went through in figuring out how to combine [LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element) with [Ag-Grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/). Hopefully this helps someone out there!

## Quickstart

Paste this onto your command line:

`git clone https://github.com/ashrafhadden/pwa-starter-kit-ag-grid.git && cd pwa-starter-kit-ag-grid && npm i && npm run start`

This will automatically clone, install, serve and open a new tab with the application running.
